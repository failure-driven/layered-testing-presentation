          <aside class="notes">
            Selena: Hi everyone, thanks for joining us today. I'm Selena and this Michael, we're going to
              talk you about...

            Michael: "Failing for the right reason!" - how to write tests that fail and drive out a perfect design
              for your software

            Selena: and it's going to be a great time. Are you guys excited? I'm excited! Where do we start?!

              Michael: Well... I've been thinking about it and I've come up with this great idea for an app!! People are gonna love it

              Selena: Oh yeah...? That only took you what? 20 years?

              Michael: haha fuck off

          <h3>An idea for an app</h3>

          <aside class="notes">
            Michael: So, the idea is a guessing game! (michael run through rough diagram/explanation while Selena questions it)

            Selena: Alright cool, let's build it!

            Michael: OK sweet, I think I have an idea on how the DB schema might fit together. There's going
              to be a Game object and Rounds and some sort of Score for the players, I presume I will need
              an image display react component, a timer and an input form, so I'll just start smashing that
              together and see where we get to...

            Selena: Wait, what? aren't we TDDing this? You need to start with a test.

            Michael: What at the beginning? before I write any code? but I don't know where I'm going.
              Why the fuck would I do that?

          <h1>Why testing matters</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
              (Selena explains to the Junior dev why TDD matters & why you would start with a test)
            Analogy? If you could stop time and know the acceleration and mass
            of every particle in space you could predict the future.

            So with software, time does not stop and you are dreaming to have
            this amazing control of predicting the need of users, the browsers
            they will have, the various bugs that will bump various library
            versions, how users abuse the features you have and how priorities
            will change and features maybe even whole company strategies may
            pivot.

            And that is why you need testing, to know at any point in time that
            what you wanted to work a particular way, still works that way. And
            the easiest way to make sure your tests are relatively simple to
            write and your code is easy to reason about is to write the tests
            first, have them drive out the code required, have them "Design"
            the code you need Test Driven Design.

            IDEA: catapult calculations vs someone throwing a ball, or many
            balls, or many objects while walking over terrain, how do you know
            that their feature still works

          <h1>The biggest Unit</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
              Michael: Ohhhh so I need to start by testing the biggest unit. Well, that's obviously the Game object...

              Selena: Obviously not. No, let's go back to your drawing and take a closer look. See here, you've already
              drawn it out. This thing interacts with that thing and another thing through an API. And you're probably
              going to display it all using some sort of front end - have you thought about the tech stack?

              Michael: Yes. This part will be react, the API will be exposed from a Rails backend which talks to a
              Postgres database. OHHH I get it now! This whole thing is a unit! Because this thing interacts with that
              thing and another thing through an API. And that will all be displayed in a SPA

              Selena: Now you're getting it!


            What's a unit anyway?
            TDD vs BDD?
            RSpec
            the stack? or is that part of emergent architecture?

              So here is my game, I have a round, a timer counting down the

              the phrase on the right, maybe a submit button at the bottom, how
              do I get started testing this?
            Selena:
              You have to think in flows, where things start how they flow
              through what steps and ultimately where they end up. Where do you
              think your game starts?

              actually pronouced RSpec you dag. RSpec is a unit testing
              framework, Capybara is an accceptance testing framework that
              allows you to simulate how a user interacts with your
              application, and Selenium is a driver for web browser automation.
            Michael:
              Ah so I will write unit tests asserting expectations using
              ree-spec, these will use Capybara methods to drive behaviour that
              a user would make and these commands will ultimately drive a real
              browser using Selenium.
            Selena:
              Correct

              See all these css selectors, they are not the responsibilty of
              the lifecycle flow. At the lifecycle flow we are talking about
              the big user driven actions. These are tightly linked to the
              implementation, they are pages or components on page like page
              fragments. let's take a look at your app again ...

            step by step:
                Scenario "Casper plays to win, and have a good time"
                - When Casper starts the game
                - Then round 1 begins
                    - display 9 images of "ghosts"
                    - start timer with 10 seconds left
                    - text box for answers
                - When Casper types in the correct answer of "ghosts"
                - Then the timer stops
                    - You get notified ghosts is correct answer
                    - score of 10 seconds - time to type is presented
                    - alert showing 3 seconds till next round pops up
                - When the next round timer expires
                - Then the next round is displayed
                    - with 9 new images (of "gremlins")
                - When Casper guesses wrongly
                    - typing "furby monster cat"
                - Then a wrong guess message appears
                - When the time runs out
                - Then Casper gets 0 points
                    - redirected to next round
                - When Casper is presented with round 3
                    - images of haunted houses
                    - guessing "pizza wine beer"
                    - typing "haunted house"
                - Then upon writing the correct guess
                    - the timer stops
                    - the guess is highlighted as correct
                    - a score is shown
                - When the round finished
                - Then Casper is taken to result page
                    - showing final score
                    - and run down of rounds
                    - and he can tweet it to his followers cause he's popular as fuck
                RUN it in reality

              Keep your cool, it is layered and iterative, for each layer we go
              down to the next layer. Only when we get to the bottom of the
              onion of layers can we walk back up the tests and see everything
