            Michael:
              explain the app as we page through some images of the user flow
            Selena:
              seet bro let's build it
            Michael:
              OK, I think I have an idea on how the DB schema might fit
              togehter to organise a Game into Rounds and tally a scoreboard of
              players, I presume I will need an image display react component,
              a timer and an input form, lets write some code ...
            Selena:
              NOOOOO don't do that, start with a test first!
            Michael:
              What at the beginning? before I write any code? before I have a design?

          <h1>Why testing matters</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            Analogy? If you could stop time and know the acceleration and mass
            of every particle in space you could predict the future.

            So with software, time does not stop and you are dreaming to have
            this amazing control of predicting the need of users, the browsers
            they will have, the various bugs that will bump various library
            versions, how users abuse the features you have and how priorities
            will change and features maybe even whole company strategies may
            pivot.

            And that is why you need testing, to know at any point in time that
            what you wanted to work a particular way, still works that way. And
            the easiest way to make sure your tests are relatively simple to
            write and your code is easy to reason about is to write the tests
            first, have them drive out the code reqruied, have them "Design"
            the code you need Test Driven Design.

              Oh cool let me add this spec for a guess with a typo ...
            Selena:
              STOP flow specs have the following resonsiblities ... and your
              idea of another spec is a layer down

              Explain step by step how it is like a flow, follow along with
              code snippets and slides showing the action in the game.

            How to decide what to test in mechanic vs FE component
            Michael:
              Cool it looks good on the page, back up to the mechanic - ahh but the test still does not pass!???
            Selena:
              Keep your cool, it is layered and iterative, for each layer we go
              down to the next layer. Only when we get to the bottom of the
              onion of layers can we walk back up the tests and see everything
              pass.
