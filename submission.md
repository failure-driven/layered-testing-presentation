### Title

Failing for the right reason - a fresh look on TDD

### Elevator Pitch
_300 characters as exciting and enticing as possible_

  Real code, live demo, learn to write tests to drive out code from the very
  beginning! Ever had difficulty writing tests? Don't know how to identify the
  unit under test? Find it hard to write tests BEFORE implementation? Join us
  as we take you on a journey through multilayer outside-in BDD.

### Talk Format

  20min

### Audience Level

  All

### Description

_contemporary experience, beyond single application, diversity, novel experiences or developments_

  You have a great idea for a web app but you have no idea how it’s all going
  to fit together and you may have heard that writing tests might be a good
  idea but are not sure where to start? Learn how to drive your design from the
  customer level interactions, right through to the smallest units of the
  domain with multi-layer outside-in behavioural driven design (BDD).

  So come and join a software developer with 20 years experience along side a
  developer having only learnt to BDD in the last 12 months build a fun game
  live on stage. This talk will make testing fun, accessible to everyone from
  novice to experienced and introduce participants to a framework for writing
  tests that has been developed and refined across many years, companies and
  codebases over the last 15 years. The app is built as a modern web app
  written with a Rails API and ReactJS frontend using RSpec, Capybara, Selenium
  webdriver and Jest for testing.

  Participants will be taken through the core outer layer of BDD, "lifecycle
  flows", to drive out a customer driven user interaction. This will include:

  * words matter, how to write descriptive tests that will make sense 6 months
    down the track
  * using a real non trivial example app
  * explaining how to get started from the very beginning
  * explain how to keep the right level of focus at this outer layer
  * showing how these types of tests can scale in a real size application
  * highlighting what does not have to be tested at this level
  * everything is a Unit, just depending on the boundary you put around it
  * what failures to expect to happen and where
  * idiomatic RSpec shortcuts don't always lead to good tests

  Summing up will include how ultimately "lifecycle flows" are just the tip of
  the iceberg of a more comprehensive layered approach, the details of which
  are beyond the scope of this talk:

  * **"Lifecycle Flow"**
  * **"Page/Component Mechanics"**
  * **"Frontend Component Tests"**
  * **"External Integration Tests"**
  * **"API Acceptance Tests"**
  * **"Controller Unit Tests"**
  * **"Domain Concept Tests"**
  * **"Domain Unit Tests"**

  We hope that attendees will walk away from this talk reaching for tests as
  the first tool in building out a new feature in their current project. The
  overview of lifecycle flows is a valuable tool in both breaking out user and
  system interactions in relation to a new or existing feature as well as
  ensuring the design is robust and long lived through the assurance of tests.
  If we whet their appetite enough they can also go through our sample code
  app to get an idea about the other layers of this technique.

### Notes

  Technical requirements:

    The talk is aimed at beginners who may have heard about TDD, through to
    intermediate developers who just don’t know how to test all parts of their
    applications right through to advanced developers looking at how tests can
    scale in a large ruby/rails codebase.

    The talk is to be presented by 2 presenters. Both presenters would prefer
    lapel microphones to allow easy movement on stage and as there will be a
    small amount of live coding.

  Best people for this subject:

    The style of Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) used at the workplace of
    the presenters has been refined by the CTO and core testing practice lead
    at the company over the last 15+ years across his time at Thoughtworks and
    later in numerous companies. The presenters have diverse experience of BDD
    with 1 presenter 10 years BDD and 20 years in software development
    experience, while the other presenter has less then 3 years in software
    development and recently learning BDD. This gives them a unique opportunity
    to address both experienced developers and up and comers just learning, by
    bringing a perspective of someone who has just freshly learned the
    concepts.

    Together they present in an accessible way from beginner through intermediate
    to experienced. Also basing the presentation on an open source demo of the
    style of testing gives participants of the talk a valuable resource to find
    out in more depth about this style of writing software.
